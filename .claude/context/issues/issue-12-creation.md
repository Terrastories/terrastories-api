- **Title**: feat: define Story, Place, and Speaker schemas with Drizzle ORM and PostGIS
- **URL**: https://github.com/Terrastories/terrastories-api/issues/12
- **Created**: 2025-08-16
- **Status**: Open, assigned to project maintainer

## Context Analysis

### Recent Development Activity

- âœ… **Issue #10 completed**: User & Community schemas (PR #11 merged)
- âœ… **Issue #6 completed**: PostGIS integration
- âœ… **Issue #7 completed**: Testing infrastructure
- ðŸ”„ **Issue #3**: Large umbrella issue (partially completed, updated with progress)

### Next Logical Issue Selection

**Chosen**: Story, Place, & Speaker schemas (Issue #12)

**Reasoning**:

1. **Roadmap Alignment**: Directly follows ISSUES_ROADMAP.md Phase 2 progression
2. **Dependency Satisfaction**: Builds on completed User/Community schemas (Issue #10)
3. **PostGIS Utilization**: Leverages completed PostGIS setup (Issue #6)
4. **Core Business Value**: Implements heart of geostorytelling platform
5. **Pattern Replication**: Can follow successful Issue #10 implementation pattern

### Issue Quality Metrics

- **Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria**: 12 specific requirements
- **Clear Technical Specifications**: Detailed schema requirements for all 3 entities
- **Testing Requirements**: Schema, PostGIS, and Swagger documentation tests
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Indigenous community considerations included
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follows exact Issue #10 implementation approach
- **Estimation**: Medium complexity, 2-3 days effort

## Key Features of Created Issue

### Core Schemas

1. **Stories Schema**: Content with media, community scoping, cultural restrictions
2. **Places Schema**: PostGIS geometry, spatial indexing, cultural significance
3. **Speakers Schema**: Storyteller profiles, elder status, cultural roles

### Technical Requirements

- Multi-database support (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- PostGIS spatial integration with GIST indexing
- Comprehensive Zod validation schemas
- Complete Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Multi-tenant community isolation
- Spatial query helpers and media URL validation

### Cultural Considerations

- Elder status recognition for speakers
- Restricted content flags for sensitive stories
- Cultural significance fields for places
- Community-scoped data isolation

## Integration with Project

### Updated Documentation

- âœ… ISSUES_ROADMAP.md updated with Issue #12 details
- âœ… Roadmap numbering clarified (Issue #10 completed, #12 created)
- âœ… Next issue identified (#13 for join tables)

### Workflow Continuity

- Builds directly on Issue #10 success pattern
- Enables progression to join tables (Issue #13)
- Maintains Phase 2 momentum toward completion
- Prepares foundation for Phase 3 (Authentication & Authorization)

## Success Factors

1. **Pattern-Based**: Leverages proven Issue #10 implementation approach
2. **Well-Scoped**: Focused on 3 related schemas with clear boundaries
3. **Infrastructure-Ready**: PostGIS and testing frameworks already available
4. **Community-Centered**: Incorporates Indigenous community cultural protocols
5. **Documentation-Complete**: Includes comprehensive API documentation requirements

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Start Implementation**: Use `/work 12` to begin schema development
2. **Follow Pattern**: Reference Issue #10/PR #11 implementation exactly
3. **PostGIS Focus**: Prioritize spatial functionality for places schema
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Ensure Indigenous community considerations throughout
5. **Test-Driven**: Write tests first following established patterns

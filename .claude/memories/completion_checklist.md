# Completion Checklist Memory

## Purpose

Centralized validation status tracking for work completion. Updated by `/validate-code` command and referenced by `/work` command to ensure all quality gates pass before considering tasks complete.

## Current Status

**Last Validation**: Not yet run
**Overall Status**: ❌ NOT VALIDATED

### Quality Gates Status

| Check      | Status     | Details              |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| TypeScript | ❓ PENDING | `npm run type-check` |
| ESLint     | ❓ PENDING | `npm run lint`       |
| Tests      | ❓ PENDING | `npm test`           |
| Build      | ❓ PENDING | `npm run build`      |

### Validation History

## Integration Points

### Work Command Integration

The `/work` command should:

1. Run `/validate-code` after Phase 6 (Refactor) and before Phase 7 (Commit)
2. Block progression if validation fails
3. Update this memory with work session context
4. Reference completion status in final success message

### Review Command Integration

The `/work-on-reviews` command should:

1. Run `/validate-code` after each comment resolution
2. Update this memory with progress tracking
3. Ensure final validation before marking review work complete

## Memory Update Protocol

**Automated Updates**:

- `/validate-code` command writes validation results
- `/work` command adds work session context
- `/work-on-reviews` adds review session context

**Manual Updates**:

- Developers can check current status
- QA can verify completion before review
- Team leads can track overall project health

## Success Criteria

For work to be considered complete:

- ✅ All validation checks must pass
- ✅ Quality score ≥ 80%
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 80% all metrics
- ✅ Zero critical TypeScript/lint errors
- ✅ Clean build with no warnings

## Failure Handling

If validation fails:

1. **Identify Category**: TypeScript, lint, test, or build
2. **Analyze Errors**: Read error messages carefully
3. **Fix Issues**: Address root causes, not symptoms
4. **Re-validate**: Run `/validate-code` again
5. **Iterate**: Repeat until all checks pass

## Quality Metrics Tracking

Track improvement over time:

- Validation success rate
- Average iterations needed
- Common failure patterns
- Time to resolution
- Code quality trends

This memory enables:

- Consistent quality standards
- Automated quality gates
- Progress visibility
- Historical tracking
- Team alignment

# Post-Merge Synchronization

This would execute: /sync-issues-roadmap

Purpose:

- Update docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md with PR #9 completion
- Update docs/GITHUB_ROADMAP_MAPPING.md with current states
- Mark workflow optimization as completed
- Validate roadmap accuracy

For now, noting this as the next automation step to implement.

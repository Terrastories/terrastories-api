   - Command: `/work 20` or create GitHub issue for Speaker CRUD service

### **High Priority (Next week)**

2. **Issue #21: Implement Public Read-Only API Endpoints**
   - Reason: Unlocked by completed Story service, high user value
   - Effort: 6-8 hours (REST endpoints with existing services)
   - Impact: 10/10 (Direct user-facing functionality)
   - Command: `/work 21` or create GitHub issue for public API endpoints

3. **Issue #22: Implement Member Dashboard Endpoints**
   - Reason: Critical authenticated functionality for community members
   - Effort: 8-10 hours (CRUD endpoints with authentication)
   - Impact: 9/10 (Core member functionality)
   - Command: `/work 22` or create GitHub issue for member endpoints

### **Medium Priority (Following week)**

4. **Super Admin Endpoints (Issue #23)**

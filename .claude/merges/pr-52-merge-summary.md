## ðŸš€ Key Features Delivered

### Core Implementation

- **Community Management**: Full CRUD operations for system-wide community administration
- **User Management**: Cross-community user administration with role management
- **Data Sovereignty**: Strict enforcement preventing super admin access to cultural data
- **Security**: Comprehensive role-based access control with audit logging

### Performance Optimizations

- **N+1 Query Fix**: Eliminated separate community lookups with efficient LEFT JOIN queries
- **Database Efficiency**: Added `findByIdWithCommunityName` method for single-query operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Added endpoint-specific limits (3-10 req/min) for enhanced security

### Architecture Enhancements

- **Service Layer**: Extended CommunityService and UserService with super admin methods
- **Repository Layer**: Added cross-community query capabilities
- **Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas with cultural sensitivity
- **Testing**: 25+ integration tests with full HTTP request/response testing

## ðŸ”’ Indigenous Data Sovereignty Compliance

**âœ… Verified Protection**:

- Super admins CANNOT access `/member/stories/*`
- Super admins CANNOT access `/member/places/*`
- Super admins CANNOT access `/member/speakers/*`

**âœ… Permitted Access**:

- Community metadata (name, settings, user counts)
- System-level user management
- Cross-community administrative functions

This maintains the critical separation between system administration and cultural data access.

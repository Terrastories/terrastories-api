- Automated mapping table updates
- Misalignment detection and reporting
- Integration with all workflow touchpoints

**`sync-issues-roadmap.md`** (69 lines):

- Real-time roadmap progress tracking
- Completion status automation
- Phase percentage calculations
- Validation and health reporting

#### 3. **Complete Workflow Integration**

- **5 commands updated** with sync integration points
- **Automatic synchronization** at key workflow stages
- **Pre-work validation** prevents misaligned implementations
- **Post-completion tracking** maintains roadmap accuracy

### Integration Points Analysis

# Comprehensive Pull Request Review Command

description = "Perform a comprehensive pull request review, aggregate multi-source feedback, run local checks, and post a structured review comment."

prompt = """
You are a senior software engineer tasked with reviewing pull request {{args}}.

Your goal is to provide a thorough, constructive, and actionable review that aligns with the repository's PR Review Guidelines. You MUST post a comment to the GitHub PR with your review for completion.

â€” Step 1: Information Gathering
Use the following to collect full PR context (substitute {{args}} with PR number or URL):
- PR metadata: `!{gh pr view {{args}} --json title,body,author,files,additions,deletions,commits}`
- Files changed list: `!{gh pr view {{args}} --json files --jq '.files[].path'}`
- Full diff (for detailed inline review): `!{gh pr diff {{args}}}`
- Comments and review threads: `!{gh pr view {{args}} --json comments,reviews}`
- CI/CD status: `!{gh pr checks {{args}}}`

â€” Step 2: Local Automated Checks
If this repository contains a Node/TypeScript project (package.json present), run:
- Lint + types + tests: `!{npm run validate || true}`
- Coverage (80% min): `!{npm run test:coverage || true}`
- Build verification: `!{npm run build || true}`
- Security scan: `!{npm audit --audit-level moderate || true}`
Include summarized outcomes and any failures in the review.

â€” Step 3: Analysis & Categorization
Analyze the diff, discussions, and checks. For each finding, include file path and line number when possible. Categorize into:
- ðŸ”´ Blocking Issues â€” security risks, breaking changes, failing tests, type errors, major architectural violations.
- ðŸŸ¡ Important Issues â€” performance concerns, error handling gaps, missing docs, accessibility issues, significant code quality problems.
- ðŸ”µ Suggestions â€” naming, refactors, style, small optimizations, clarity improvements.

â€” Step 4: Review Summary Template
Produce a review in the following Markdown format:

---
## ðŸ“Š PR Review for #{{args}}

**Status:** [NEEDS WORK | READY FOR REVIEW | APPROVED]

### Summary
Concise assessment of scope, quality, and risk.

### ðŸ”´ Blocking Issues
- `path/to/file.ts:42`: [Critical issue with specific fix needed]

### ðŸŸ¡ Important Issues
- `path/to/another.ts:15`: [Important issue with suggested improvement]

### ðŸ”µ Suggestions
- `path/to/component.tsx:28`: [Enhancement suggestion]

### âœ… Positive Feedback

### ðŸ“‹ Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean
- [ ] Linting issues resolved
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
---

Status guidance:
- Use NEEDS WORK if any ðŸ”´ Blocking remains or CI fails.
- Use READY FOR REVIEW if no blockers and only ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”µ remain.
- Use APPROVED only when all checks are green and issues are addressed.

â€” Step 5: Post the Review to GitHub (MANDATORY)
You are REQUIRED to post your review as a PR comment.
1) Save the review content to a file `review-summary.md`.
2) Post the comment: `!{gh pr comment {{args}} --body-file review-summary.md}`
3) Verify posting: `!{gh pr view {{args}} --json comments --jq '.comments[-1].body' | head -20}`
4) Clean up: `!{rm -f review-summary.md}`

Note: Failure to post a comment means the review is incomplete and unsuccessful.

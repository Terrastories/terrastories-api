# WIP: Test Fixes Progress - Issue #59 Production Readiness

## Current Status

Working on resolving failing tests for production readiness validation. Made significant progress on infrastructure fixes but discovered additional test failures during validation.

## Completed Key Fixes

1. **✅ Database Schema** - Added `privacy_level` column to stories table
2. **✅ ActiveStorage Migration** - Fixed rollback functionality and SQL parsing
3. **✅ Upload Directory Structure** - Created proper community-scoped directories
4. **✅ Offline File Service** - Fixed URL generation for field-kit mode
5. **✅ Migration Database** - Created `0005_add_privacy_level.sql`

## Current Test Issues

Tests are showing more failures than original 14, likely due to:

- Schema changes causing downstream effects
- TypeScript compilation issues from new column
- Test dependencies and isolation problems
- Environment setup issues from infrastructure changes

## Next Steps (for continuation)

1. **Immediate Priority**: Run full test suite analysis to get accurate failure count
2. **Schema Integration**: Ensure new privacy_level column is properly integrated across all services
3. **Test Environment**: Fix test setup to handle new schema and directory structure
4. **TypeScript Issues**: Resolve any type compilation errors
5. **Test Isolation**: Ensure test cleanup doesn't interfere with new structures

## Key Files Modified

- `src/db/schema/stories.ts` - Added privacy_level column
- `src/services/activestorage-migrator.ts` - Fixed rollback SQL parsing
- `src/services/file.service.ts` - Added offline URL generation
- `src/db/migrations/0005_add_privacy_level.sql` - New migration
- Upload directories created: `uploads/community_1/`, `community_2/`, `community_3/`
- Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/activestorage/backup-test/`

## Commit Message Used

"fix: resolve critical test infrastructure issues for production readiness

- Add privacy_level column to stories schema (PostgreSQL + SQLite)
- Fix ActiveStorage migration rollback functionality with proper SQL parsing
- Create required upload directory structure for community isolation
- Add offline mode support for Field Kit deployment file URLs
- Implement proper test fixtures for migration rollback testing

Addresses core infrastructure blockers identified in issue #59 Phase 1-3.
Additional test stabilization needed for full production readiness."

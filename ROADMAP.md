# Terrastories Migration Roadmap

## ‚úÖ MILESTONE ACHIEVED: Backend Migration Complete!

**üéâ The Rails-to-TypeScript backend migration has been successfully completed!** See our comprehensive [Migration Completion Report](./docs/MIGRATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md) for full details.

## Current Status: Production Ready & Frontend Migration Planning

The backend API migration is now **COMPLETE** with full production deployment readiness. All 75+ GitHub issues across 7 phases have been successfully implemented with comprehensive testing and cultural protocol validation.

### üìç Migration Achievements: [docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md](./docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md)

- **‚úÖ ALL 7 PHASES COMPLETED** - Full Rails-to-TypeScript migration
- **‚úÖ 75+ GitHub Issues Resolved** - Comprehensive feature implementation
- **‚úÖ Production Infrastructure** - Docker, CI/CD, monitoring ready
- **‚úÖ Indigenous Data Sovereignty** - Cultural protocol compliance verified
- **‚úÖ Performance Validated** - <50ms average response times achieved
- **‚úÖ Test Coverage** - 80%+ coverage with 471+ comprehensive tests

### üöÄ Next Phase: Frontend Separation

With backend migration complete, we now transition to frontend modernization:

- **Reference**: [docs/FRONTEND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./docs/FRONTEND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- **Approach**: Standalone React application with modern tooling
- **State Management**: Zustand/Redux Toolkit implementation
- **Capabilities**: Maintained offline-first architecture for Indigenous communities

## Migration Strategy

### Phase A: Backend API ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal**: Replace Rails backend with TypeScript API  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - See **[Migration Completion Report](./docs/MIGRATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md)** for comprehensive results
**Achievement**: Full feature parity with enhanced Indigenous data sovereignty protection

**Critical Priority Changes**:

- **PostGIS Integration**: Moved to Phase 1 (foundational requirement)
- **Data Sovereignty Validation**: Added to Phase 2 (cannot be assumed)
- **Offline-First Design**: Integrated from Phase 1 (affects all decisions)
- **ActiveStorage Migration**: Dedicated phase for complexity management

### Phase B: Frontend Separation (Future)

**Goal**: Extract React from Rails into standalone app
**Approach**: Follow [docs/FRONTEND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./docs/FRONTEND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

### Phase C: Community Validation & Production Deployment

**Goal**: Indigenous community testing, production deployment, and stability
**Includes**: Cultural protocol validation, offline scenario testing, performance optimization

## Quick Links

- **Current Sprint**: Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Terrastories/terrastories-api/issues)
- **Backend Progress**: See [docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md](./docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md)
- **Frontend Plans**: See [docs/FRONTEND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./docs/FRONTEND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- **Setup Guide**: See [docs/SETUP.md](./docs/SETUP.md)

## Critical Migration Insights (Based on Analysis)

### üö® Key Realizations

1. **PostGIS is Foundational**: Geographic data is core to Terrastories identity, not optional
2. **Offline-First Affects Everything**: Must be designed from Phase 1, not added later
3. **Data Sovereignty Cannot Be Assumed**: Requires dedicated validation and testing
4. **ActiveStorage Complexity**: Polymorphic associations need careful migration strategy
5. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Missing from original roadmap, essential for Indigenous communities

### üìà Updated Velocity Targets

Velocity and timeline are actively tracked within our detailed roadmap document. Please refer to **[Active Backend Roadmap](./docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md)** for the most current estimates.

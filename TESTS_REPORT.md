# Test Analysis Report

## Overview

Analysis of failing tests in the Terrastories TypeScript backend migration project.

**Test Suite Statistics:**

- Total test files: 74
- Status: Tests are currently failing with specific integration and API issues
- Main issues: API validation failures and offline functionality problems

## Identified Test Failures

### 1. Field Kit Deployment Test Failure

**File:** `tests/production/field-kit-deployment.test.ts:363`
**Test:** "CRUD operations work with local SQLite database"

**Error:**

```
AssertionError: create_place should work offline (status: 400): expected 400 to be less than 400
```

**Analysis:**

- Place creation API call returning 400 status code instead of successful response (< 400)
- This suggests validation or request format issues in offline mode
- Could be related to PostGIS/SQLite compatibility issues or missing required fields

### 2. Speakers API Test Failure

**File:** `tests/routes/speakers.test.ts:231`
**Test:** "should create speaker with minimal data"

**Error:**

```
AssertionError: expected 400 to be 201 // Object.is equality
```

**Analysis:**

- Speaker creation with minimal data returning 400 instead of expected 201
- Indicates validation issues or missing required fields in speaker creation endpoint
- The test expects minimal data to be sufficient, but API is rejecting the request

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Configuration Issues

**File:** `vitest.config.ts`

- ✅ Proper test isolation with forks
- ✅ Appropriate timeouts (60s)
- ✅ Database URL configured for SQLite memory
- ⚠️ High coverage thresholds (80%) may be blocking development

### Environment Setup

**File:** `tests/setup.ts`

- ✅ Proper test environment initialization
- ✅ Database setup and teardown
- ✅ Data clearing between tests
- ⚠️ Global setup may be causing race conditions

## Common Patterns Identified

### Database Issues

1. **Migration State**: Tests show database migration warnings
2. **Data Isolation**: Foreign key constraint handling present but may have gaps
3. **SQLite/PostGIS**: Compatibility issues between PostGIS features and SQLite testing

### API Validation Issues

1. **Required Fields**: Tests failing on validation suggest schema mismatches
2. **Authentication**: Session handling appears to work but payload validation fails
3. **Community Isolation**: Some tests pass community isolation but others fail

### Test Environment

1. **Parallel Execution**: 74 test files with complex database operations
2. **Memory Database**: SQLite in-memory may not support all PostGIS features
3. **Setup Complexity**: Multiple initialization phases may cause timing issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues

1. **API Schema Validation**: Mismatch between test data and expected API schemas
2. **Database Feature Parity**: SQLite test environment missing PostGIS capabilities
3. **Request Format**: Tests may be using outdated request formats or missing headers

### Secondary Issues

1. **Test Data**: Seed data may not match current schema requirements
2. **Authentication Flow**: Session management complexity in test environment
3. **Parallel Test Execution**: Race conditions in database setup/teardown

## Progress Update (September 18, 2025 - 22:50 UTC)

### ✅ Phase 1 Progress - COMPLETED Critical Fixes

**TODO 1: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix Speaker API Validation**

- **Issue**: `photoUrl` field validation in `CreateSpeakerSchema` failed when undefined
- **Root Cause**: Zod schema used `.string().transform().pipe()` pattern that failed on undefined input
- **Solution**: Changed to `.union([z.string().url(), z.literal(''), z.undefined()]).optional().transform()`
- **Files Modified**: `/src/routes/speakers.ts`
- **Result**: All 41 speaker API tests now passing ✅

**TODO 2: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix Field Kit Place Creation**

- **Issue**: Place creation in offline mode returned 400 status (validation error)
- **Root Cause**: Same photoUrl validation issue in `CreatePlaceSchema` in member types
- **Solution**: Applied same fix to `/src/shared/types/member.ts`
- **Files Modified**: `/src/shared/types/member.ts`
- **Result**: Field Kit deployment tests now passing ✅

### Current Test Status

- **Speakers API**: 41/41 tests passing ✅
- **Field Kit Deployment**: 20/20 tests passing ✅
- **Total Critical Failures Fixed**: 2/2 ✅

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete ✅

- [x] All critical failing tests pass
- [x] Speaker API tests work with minimal data
- [x] Field Kit offline functionality works
- [ ] No database migration warnings (still pending)

### Phase 2 Complete

- [ ] PostGIS features properly mocked in tests

- **Parallel Test Issues**: Race conditions could cause flaky tests

### Low Risk

- **Test Data Quality**: Can be improved incrementally
- **Documentation**: Missing docs slow onboarding but don't block development
- **Performance Optimization**: Nice to have but not critical for functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Start with TODO 1** - Fix Speaker API validation issues
2. **Get tests passing** - Focus on green build before optimization
3. **Document findings** - Update this report as issues are resolved
4. **Team coordination** - Ensure changes don't conflict with ongoing development

# Test Analysis Report

## Overview

Analysis of failing tests in the Terrastories TypeScript backend migration project.

**Test Suite Statistics:**

- Total test files: 74
- Status: Tests are currently failing with specific integration and API issues
- Main issues: API validation failures and offline functionality problems

## Identified Test Failures

### 1. Field Kit Deployment Test Failure

**File:** `tests/production/field-kit-deployment.test.ts:363`
**Test:** "CRUD operations work with local SQLite database"

**Error:**

```
AssertionError: create_place should work offline (status: 400): expected 400 to be less than 400
```

**Analysis:**

- Place creation API call returning 400 status code instead of successful response (< 400)
- This suggests validation or request format issues in offline mode
- Could be related to PostGIS/SQLite compatibility issues or missing required fields

### 2. Speakers API Test Failure

**File:** `tests/routes/speakers.test.ts:231`
**Test:** "should create speaker with minimal data"

**Error:**

```
AssertionError: expected 400 to be 201 // Object.is equality
```

**Analysis:**

- Speaker creation with minimal data returning 400 instead of expected 201
- Indicates validation issues or missing required fields in speaker creation endpoint
- The test expects minimal data to be sufficient, but API is rejecting the request

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Configuration Issues

**File:** `vitest.config.ts`

- ✅ Proper test isolation with forks
- ✅ Appropriate timeouts (60s)
- ✅ Database URL configured for SQLite memory
- ⚠️ High coverage thresholds (80%) may be blocking development

### Environment Setup

**File:** `tests/setup.ts`

- ✅ Proper test environment initialization
- ✅ Database setup and teardown
- ✅ Data clearing between tests
- ⚠️ Global setup may be causing race conditions

## Common Patterns Identified

### Database Issues

1. **Migration State**: Tests show database migration warnings
2. **Data Isolation**: Foreign key constraint handling present but may have gaps
3. **SQLite/PostGIS**: Compatibility issues between PostGIS features and SQLite testing

### API Validation Issues

1. **Required Fields**: Tests failing on validation suggest schema mismatches
2. **Authentication**: Session handling appears to work but payload validation fails
3. **Community Isolation**: Some tests pass community isolation but others fail

### Test Environment

1. **Parallel Execution**: 74 test files with complex database operations
2. **Memory Database**: SQLite in-memory may not support all PostGIS features
3. **Setup Complexity**: Multiple initialization phases may cause timing issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues

1. **API Schema Validation**: Mismatch between test data and expected API schemas
2. **Database Feature Parity**: SQLite test environment missing PostGIS capabilities
3. **Request Format**: Tests may be using outdated request formats or missing headers

### Secondary Issues

1. **Test Data**: Seed data may not match current schema requirements
2. **Authentication Flow**: Session management complexity in test environment
3. **Parallel Test Execution**: Race conditions in database setup/teardown

## Progress Update (September 18, 2025 - 22:50 UTC)

### ✅ Phase 1 Progress - COMPLETED Critical Fixes

**TODO 1: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix Speaker API Validation**

- **Issue**: `photoUrl` field validation in `CreateSpeakerSchema` failed when undefined
- **Root Cause**: Zod schema used `.string().transform().pipe()` pattern that failed on undefined input
- **Solution**: Changed to `.union([z.string().url(), z.literal(''), z.undefined()]).optional().transform()`
- **Files Modified**: `/src/routes/speakers.ts`
- **Result**: All 41 speaker API tests now passing ✅

**TODO 2: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix Field Kit Place Creation**

- **Issue**: Place creation in offline mode returned 400 status (validation error)
- **Root Cause**: Same photoUrl validation issue in `CreatePlaceSchema` in member types
- **Solution**: Applied same fix to `/src/shared/types/member.ts`
- **Files Modified**: `/src/shared/types/member.ts`
- **Result**: Field Kit deployment tests now passing ✅

**TODO 3: ✅ COMPLETED - Database Test Environment Audit**

- **Issue**: Benign database migration warnings and general environment health check
- **Root Cause**: Warning messages were expected behavior, no actual issues found
- **Solution**: Verified test infrastructure is working correctly
- **Files Modified**: Analysis only, no code changes needed
- **Result**: Database test environment confirmed healthy ✅

**TODO 4: ✅ COMPLETED - PostGIS/SQLite Compatibility Layer**

- **Issue**: Potential spatial query compatibility issues between PostgreSQL and SQLite
- **Root Cause**: Investigation revealed existing compatibility layer was well-designed
- **Solution**: Verified spatial utilities and fallback mechanisms are working properly
- **Files Modified**: Analysis only, existing `src/shared/utils/spatial.ts` and `src/db/schema/places.ts` confirmed robust
- **Result**: PostGIS/SQLite compatibility confirmed working ✅

**TODO 5: ✅ COMPLETED - Test Data Management Improvements**

- **Issue**: Spatial tests failing with foreign key constraint errors
- **Root Cause**: Tests inserting places without proper community setup, using hardcoded community IDs
- **Solution**: Added proper test data seeding with `beforeEach` setup and dynamic community IDs
- **Files Modified**: `tests/db/spatial.test.ts`, `tests/db/postgis.test.ts`
- **Result**: Spatial tests 12/12 passing (was 3/12), PostGIS tests 6/7 passing (was 1/7) ✅

### Current Test Status

- **Speakers API**: 41/41 tests passing ✅
- **Field Kit Deployment**: 20/20 tests passing ✅
- **Spatial Database Operations**: 12/12 tests passing ✅
- **PostGIS Spatial Tests**: 6/7 tests passing ✅ (1 minor duplicate data issue)
- **Member API Tests**: 12/12 tests passing ✅ (6 places + 6 speakers)
- **Total Critical Failures Fixed**: All major blocking issues resolved ✅

**TODO 6: ✅ COMPLETED - API Schema Alignment**

- **Issue**: Additional photoUrl validation inconsistencies across member and story schemas
- **Root Cause**: Same problematic `.string().transform().pipe()` pattern in multiple schemas
- **Solution**: Applied consistent validation fix to UpdatePlaceSchema, CreateSpeakerSchema, UpdateSpeakerSchema, and story speakers schema
- **Files Modified**: `src/shared/types/member.ts`, `src/shared/schemas/stories.ts`
- **Result**: Member places 6/6 passing ✅, Member speakers 6/6 passing ✅

**TODO 7: ✅ COMPLETED - Test Performance Optimization**

- **Issue**: Test execution times were excessive (76+ seconds for 41 tests)
- **Root Cause**: Full database setup/teardown and app creation for every test
- **Solution**: Conservative optimization - move database setup to beforeAll while maintaining test isolation
- **Files Modified**: `tests/routes/speakers.test.ts`
- **Result**: Maintained test reliability while achieving modest performance improvement ✅

**TODO 8: ✅ COMPLETED - Coverage and Quality Gates**

- **Issue**: Verify coverage requirements and quality gates are properly configured
- **Root Cause**: Investigation revealed existing configuration was already comprehensive
- **Solution**: Confirmed 80% coverage thresholds, TypeScript validation, and linting are properly enforced
- **Files Modified**: Analysis only, existing `vitest.config.ts` confirmed robust
- **Result**: Quality gates verified working (TypeScript ✅, Linting ✅, Coverage enforcement ✅)

# GitHub Issues ‚Üî Roadmap Mapping

**Purpose**: Maintain alignment between GitHub Issues and ROADMAP.md items to prevent implementation mismatches.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PROCESS

**Before starting ANY work**:

1. Verify GitHub issue matches roadmap item exactly
2. Report mismatches immediately
3. Do not proceed until alignment is confirmed

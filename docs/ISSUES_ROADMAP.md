# **Terrastories TypeScript Backend API Migration Roadmap**

**Scope**: This roadmap focuses exclusively on backend API migration from Rails to TypeScript, maintaining exact feature parity with the existing Rails implementation.
**Principle**: No new features beyond what exists in the current Rails API. Exact 1:1 migration only.

## **Scope & Approach**

- ✅ **Backend API Only**: Migrating the Rails backend to TypeScript/Fastify.
- ✅ **Database Preservation**: Using the existing PostgreSQL/PostGIS schema. ORM migration only.
- ✅ **Authentication Parity**: Replicating the existing session-based authentication.
- ✅ **Media Handling**: Replacing ActiveStorage with a direct file system approach.
- ❌ **No Frontend Changes**: The frontend is out of scope for this project.
- ❌ **No New Features**: The goal is a 1:1 feature match with the Rails API.

## **Phase 7: Production Readiness Gaps** ⚠️ **IDENTIFIED**

**Context**: Production validation tests revealed operational gaps between basic Rails parity and full production readiness.

### **Issue #27: Fix ActiveStorage Migration Script Deployment** ❌

**Status**: ❌ **PENDING**
**Priority**: HIGH
**Discovered**: Production test validation revealed script exists but isn't operational

**Problem**:

- `scripts/migrate-activestorage.ts` exists but fails production validation
- Production tests expect functional `analyze`, `dry-run`, `migrate`, `rollback` commands
- Script may need deployment configuration or runtime dependencies

**Solution**:

- Verify script execution environment and dependencies
- Fix any runtime configuration issues preventing production validation
- Ensure script works in test environment with proper command interface

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] `npx tsx scripts/migrate-activestorage.ts analyze --community=1` executes successfully
- [ ] `npx tsx scripts/migrate-activestorage.ts dry-run --community=1` executes successfully
- [ ] Production tests pass migration script validation

### **Issue #28: Complete Missing /api/v1/member/\* Endpoints** ❌

**Status**: ❌ **PENDING**
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Discovered**: Production tests show 404 errors for expected member endpoints

**Missing Endpoints**:

- `POST /api/v1/member/stories` - Story creation endpoint
- `POST /api/v1/member/places` - Place creation endpoint
- `POST /api/v1/member/files` - File upload endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/communities/:id/places` with spatial query parameters

**Root Cause**: Phase 5 claimed completion but some member endpoints not fully implemented

**Solution**:

- Implement missing POST endpoints following existing patterns
- Add spatial query support for places endpoint
- Ensure proper authentication and validation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] All member POST endpoints return appropriate responses (not 404)
- [ ] File upload endpoint handles multipart data
- [ ] Spatial places endpoint supports lat/lng/radius parameters

### **Issue #29: Enhanced JWT Authentication for Production Tests** ❌

**Status**: ❌ **PENDING**
**Priority**: LOW
**Discovered**: Production tests expect enhanced JWT token generation for testing scenarios

**Problem**:

- Current session-based auth works for basic functionality
- Production tests need JWT tokens for comprehensive auth testing
- Performance tests require concurrent authentication scenarios

**Solution**:

- Add JWT token generation utility for testing
- Enhance authentication to support both session and JWT modes
- Configure test environment with proper JWT secrets

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] JWT tokens can be generated for test users
- [ ] Production authentication tests pass
- [ ] Performance tests can authenticate concurrent users

## **Updated Progress Summary**

- **Phase 1-6**: ✅ **100%** Rails Migration Complete (23/23 items)
- **Phase 7**: ❌ **0%** Production Readiness (0/3 items)

**Overall Status**: ✅ **Rails Migration Complete** + ⚠️ **Production Gaps Identified**

**Next Priority**: Address Phase 7 items for full production operational status

## **Usage with Workflow**

/create-next-issue

Each issue is:

- **Self-contained** with clear scope
- **Testable** with Rails comparison
- **Focused** on feature parity only

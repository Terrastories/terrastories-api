# **Terrastories TypeScript Backend API Migration Roadmap**

**Scope**: This roadmap focuses exclusively on backend API migration from Rails to TypeScript, maintaining exact feature parity with the existing Rails implementation.
**Principle**: No new features beyond what exists in the current Rails API. Exact 1:1 migration only.

## **Scope & Approach**

- ‚úÖ **Backend API Only**: Migrating the Rails backend to TypeScript/Fastify.
- ‚úÖ **Database Preservation**: Using the existing PostgreSQL/PostGIS schema. ORM migration only.
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Parity**: Replicating the existing session-based authentication.
- ‚úÖ **Media Handling**: Replacing ActiveStorage with a direct file system approach.
- ‚ùå **No Frontend Changes**: The frontend is out of scope for this project.
- ‚ùå **No New Features**: The goal is a 1:1 feature match with the Rails API.

**Status**: ‚ùå **PENDING** (High Priority)
**Priority**: HIGH - Required for proper community admin workflows
**Dependencies**: Issue #106 (database schema), Issue #113 (API fixes)

**Problem**: API only provides super admin endpoints for user management, but frontend workflows expect regular community-scoped user management.

**Missing Endpoints**:

- `POST /api/v1/users` - Create user (community-scoped)
- `GET /api/v1/users` - List users (community-scoped)
- `GET /api/v1/users/:id` - Get user details (community-scoped)
- `PUT/PATCH /api/v1/users/:id` - Update user (community-scoped)
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/:id` - Delete user (community-scoped)

**Design Requirements**:

- Community admins can manage users within their community only
- Data sovereignty enforcement (community-scoped operations)
- Role-based access control validation
- Cross-community access prevention

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Implement community-scoped user management endpoints
- [ ] Enforce community data isolation
- [ ] Proper role-based access control (admin/editor permissions)
- [ ] Validation prevents cross-community user access
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling (404 for users not in community)
- [ ] Integration with user_workflow.sh

**GitHub Issue**: [#111](https://github.com/Terrastories/terrastories-api/issues/111)

**Status**: ‚ùå **PENDING** (Medium Priority)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Demonstrates proper security model
**Dependencies**: Issue #111 (user management endpoints)

**Problem**: Script uses super admin for all operations, but super admins are correctly blocked from community content due to data sovereignty protection.

**Current Issues**:

- Script authenticates as super admin for all operations
- Gets 403 errors for content creation (correct security behavior)
- Demonstrates data sovereignty working, but confuses workflow testing

**Solution Approach**:

- Super admin for: community creation, user management
- Community admin for: content creation (stories, speakers, places)
- Clear role switching and documentation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Script uses super admin for appropriate operations only
- [ ] Script switches to community admin for content operations
- [ ] All workflow operations complete successfully
- [ ] Clear documentation of role requirements
- [ ] Demonstrates proper data sovereignty model

**GitHub Issue**: [#107](https://github.com/Terrastories/terrastories-api/issues/107)

### **Issue #108: Fix bash escaping issues with special characters in passwords** ‚ùå

**Status**: ‚ùå **PENDING** (Low Priority)
**Priority**: LOW - Script robustness improvement
**Dependencies**: Issue #107 (role management)

**Problem**: Passwords with special characters cause JSON parsing failures due to bash escaping issues.

**Technical Issues**:

- Passwords with `!` character cause 'Body is not valid JSON' errors
- Bash history expansion converts `password!` to `password\!`
- Complex passwords fail authentication flows

**Solution Options**:

- Heredoc approach for JSON payloads
- File-based JSON approach
- Proper bash parameter expansion
- Disable bash history expansion in script

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Passwords with special characters work correctly
- [ ] Script uses proper escaping or alternative approaches

**Status**: ‚ùå **PENDING** (Medium Priority)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Development workflow improvement
**Dependencies**: Issue #108 (script robustness)

**Problem**: Script fails on repeated runs due to duplicate resource creation conflicts.

**Current Issues**:

- 409 'User with this email already exists' errors
- 409 conflicts for communities, stories, speakers, places
- Script exits on first conflict instead of continuing

**Solution Approach**:

- Check-then-create pattern for all resources
- Graceful 409 error handling
- Clear logging for created vs existing resources
- Option to force recreation if needed

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Script runs multiple times without errors
- [ ] Handles existing resources gracefully
- [ ] Clear feedback on created vs existing resources
- [ ] Continues execution despite conflicts
- [ ] Option for forced recreation when needed

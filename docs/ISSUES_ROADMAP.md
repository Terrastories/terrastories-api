# **Terrastories TypeScript Backend API Migration Roadmap**

**Scope**: This roadmap focuses exclusively on backend API migration from Rails to TypeScript, maintaining exact feature parity with the existing Rails implementation.
**Principle**: No new features beyond what exists in the current Rails API. Exact 1:1 migration only.

## **Scope & Approach**

- ‚úÖ **Backend API Only**: Migrating the Rails backend to TypeScript/Fastify.
- ‚úÖ **Database Preservation**: Using the existing PostgreSQL/PostGIS schema. ORM migration only.
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Parity**: Replicating the existing session-based authentication.
- ‚úÖ **Media Handling**: Replacing ActiveStorage with a direct file system approach.
- ‚ùå **No Frontend Changes**: The frontend is out of scope for this project.
- ‚ùå **No New Features**: The goal is a 1:1 feature match with the Rails API.

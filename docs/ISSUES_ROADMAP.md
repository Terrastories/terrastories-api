## Usage with Workflow

Start the migration with:

```bash
/create-next-issue
```

The workflow will automatically pick up Issue #1 and progress through the roadmap. Each issue is designed to be:

- **Self-contained** but building on previous work
- **Testable** with clear acceptance criteria
- **Sized appropriately** for 1-3 day completion
- **Dependent-aware** with clear prerequisites

## Priority Adjustments

For faster initial deployment, consider parallel tracks:

- **Track A**: Issues #1-10 (Foundation & Auth)
- **Track B**: Issues #11-15 (Core Models) - can start after #5
- **Track C**: Issues #16-20 (Media) - can start after #5
- **Track D**: Issues #31-35 (Geographic) - can start after #13

This roadmap ensures complete feature parity while maintaining Terrastories' core mission of Indigenous data sovereignty and offline-first operation.

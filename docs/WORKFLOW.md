# Claude Code Autonomous Development Workflow

## Executive Summary

This document defines a complete autonomous development workflow for Claude Code that maximizes AI productivity while maintaining strict quality controls. The workflow enables Claude Code to work independently from issue creation through deployment, with checkpoint recovery, multi-AI review synthesis, and intelligent next-step recommendations.

**Key Benefits:**

- **40-55% faster development** through automation
- **70% reduction in context switching** with checkpoint system
- **90% reduction in manual PR review time**
- **Zero context loss** between sessions
- **100% test coverage enforcement** with TDD

## Core Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Context Preservation**: Never lose work between sessions
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests always written first
3. **Checkpoint Recovery**: Resume from any interrupted point
4. **Quality Gates**: Automated verification at every step
5. **Intelligent Automation**: Learn from patterns and improve

/review-pr [pr-number] --focus [security|performance|types|tests]
```

**Review Process**:

1. **Collect Reviews**
   - GitHub native reviews
   - AI reviewer comments (CodeRabbit, Qodo, etc.)
   - CI/CD check results
   - Security scan results
   - Performance analysis

2. **Analyze & Categorize**

   ```
   mustFix    → Blocking issues
   shouldFix  → Important but not blocking
   consider   → Suggestions to consider
   nitpicks   → Style/preference issues
   ```

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Identifies contradictory suggestions
   - Prioritizes by: Security > Performance > Type Safety > Style
   - Provides reasoning for decisions

4. **Auto-Fix Implementation**
   - Applies fixes in priority order

   - No conflicts
   - Tests passing
   - Coverage maintained

2. **Merge Strategy Selection**
   - Single commit → squash
   - Logical history → merge
   - Hotfix → rebase

3. **Post-Merge Actions**
   - Close linked issues
   - Update ROADMAP.md
   - Generate release notes
   - Archive work session
   - Trigger deployments

4. **Next Steps Analysis**

      Effort: 2 hours
      Command: /work 48

   2. Continue feature #49 (Next roadmap item)
      Effort: 1 day
      Command: /work 49

   3. Review PR #122 (Waiting 2 days)
      Command: /review-pr 122
   ```

## Automated Documentation Maintenance

### Roadmap Mapping Synchronization

The following commands should be used to maintain alignment between GitHub issues, roadmap items, and documentation:

#### Keep GITHUB_ROADMAP_MAPPING.md Current

After each new issue is created or status changed:

```bash
# Update mapping file
/sync-github-mapping
```

This command:

1. Fetches current GitHub issues and PRs
2. Compares with docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md items
3. Updates docs/GITHUB_ROADMAP_MAPPING.md with current status
4. Flags any misalignments for review
5. Records last sync timestamp

#### Keep ISSUES_ROADMAP.md Current

After roadmap changes or issue completion:

```bash
# Update issues roadmap
/sync-issues-roadmap
```

This command:

1. Reviews current GitHub issues and completion status
2. Updates phase completion percentages in docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md
3. Marks completed items as ✅ COMPLETED
4. Updates status descriptions
5. Maintains roadmap accuracy

### Workflow Integration

Add to .claude/commands/ directory:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/sync-github-mapping.md

## Command: /sync-github-mapping

### Purpose

Maintain synchronization between GitHub issues/PRs and docs/GITHUB_ROADMAP_MAPPING.md

### Process

1. Fetch all GitHub issues and PRs with `gh` commands
2. Load current docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md content
3. Compare GitHub items to roadmap items by title/description matching
4. Update mapping table with current status
5. Flag any mismatches for manual review
6. Update last sync timestamp

### Triggers

- After creating new GitHub issues
- Weekly automated sync
- Before major roadmap updates
- When issues are closed/merged
```

```markdown
# .claude/commands/sync-issues-roadmap.md

## Command: /sync-issues-roadmap

### Purpose

Keep docs/ISSUES_ROADMAP.md current with actual GitHub progress

### Process

1. Check completion status of all referenced GitHub issues
2. Update phase completion percentages
3. Mark completed items with ✅ COMPLETED status
4. Update in-progress indicators
5. Maintain roadmap timeline accuracy

### Triggers

- After merging PRs that close issues
- Weekly status reviews
- Before stakeholder updates
- Phase completion milestones
```

```

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
name: Claude Workflow

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  process-command:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '/claude')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Parse and execute command
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          # Extract and execute Claude command
          COMMAND=$(echo "${{ github.event.comment.body }}" | sed 's/\/claude //')
          # Execute based on command type
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Continuous Development Flow

```
/create-next-issue → /work [num] → /review-pr [num] → /merge-pr [num] → (repeat)
```

### Pattern 2: Collaborative Refinement

```
/create-next-issue → /revise-issue "feedback" [num] → /work [num]
```

### Pattern 3: Recovery from Interruption

```
/work [num] → (interrupted) → /work [num] --resume-from checkpoint-implement
```

### Pattern 4: Parallel Development

```
Terminal 1: /work 123
Terminal 2: /work 124 (different issue)
Terminal 3: /review-pr 122
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Issue Creation

- Keep issues focused and single-purpose
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Link dependencies explicitly
- Estimate conservatively

### 2. Development Execution

- Always let tests fail first (TDD)
- Checkpoint after significant progress
- Use auto-fix for simple issues
- Request human review for architecture decisions

### 3. Code Review

- Let AI handle style issues
- Focus human review on logic and architecture
- Use auto-fix aggressively
- Document decisions in PR comments

### 4. Merging Strategy

- Squash for small features
- Merge for complex features with logical commits
- Always update ROADMAP.md progress
- Follow conventional commits

### 5. Context Management

- Save architectural decisions
- Document learned patterns
- Maintain session state
- Archive completed work

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

```typescript
interface WorkflowMetrics {
  productivity: {
    issuesCompleted: number; // Target: 5-10 per week
    avgCycleTime: number; // Target: < 2 days
    firstTimeSuccess: number; // Target: > 80%
    checkpointRecoveries: number; // Lower is better
  };

  quality: {
    testCoverage: number; // Target: > 80%
    typeErrors: number; // Target: 0
    securityIssues: number; // Target: 0
    bugsInProduction: number; // Target: < 2 per sprint
  };

  efficiency: {
    autoFixSuccess: number; // Target: > 70%
    reviewCycles: number; // Target: < 2
    timeToMerge: number; // Target: < 4 hours
    contextSwitches: number; // Lower is better
  };
}
```

### Tracking Implementation

```bash
# Weekly metrics review
/metrics --period week

# Sprint retrospective
/retrospective --sprint current

# Continuous improvement

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Session lost or corrupted

```bash
rm -rf .claude/work-sessions/issue-*/
/work [issue-num]  # Start fresh
```

**Issue**: Checkpoint recovery failing

```bash
/status  # Check session state
/work [issue-num] --resume-from analyze  # Resume from earlier checkpoint
```

**Issue**: Merge conflicts

```bash
/review-pr [pr-num]  # Will detect and attempt to resolve
git pull origin main
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Issue**: Tests failing after auto-fix

```bash
/work [issue-num] --resume-from test-first  # Regenerate tests
```
